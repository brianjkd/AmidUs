#### About
Amid Us is fan inspired Unity project based on Among Us. This project is bare bones but functional.
Many features like vents, emergency meetings, and any level of polish are missing. The code is also
pretty spaghetti, and not very well structured.

#### Why
The goal of Amid Us is to provide a working project for people interested in making their own multiplayer
party games with Unity and who want a small working project to start with for reference. 
**Amid Us is not meant to be an Among Us replacement or compete at all with Among Us.** 
Other than a lack of Mac support, game party size cap of 10, and some networking issues, Among Us is a perfect game.

#### Game Builds
Note, these game builds use Steam P2P, so you must be running Steam before launching the game.
